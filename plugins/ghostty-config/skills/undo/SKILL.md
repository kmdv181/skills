# Rolling back a Ghostty config change

Restores one of the last five backups taken by `ghostty-apply.sh`.

**Always show the list and let the user choose.** Never pick a backup for them, even when they say "just undo the last thing" — see why below.

## Flow

```sh
sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ghostty-undo.sh" --list
```

Numbered newest-first, with a readable timestamp and the config each one belongs to. Show it to the user as-is and ask which one they want.

```sh
sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ghostty-undo.sh" --diff <N>
sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ghostty-undo.sh" --restore <N>
```

`<N>` is the number from the list, or a backup filename. Show the diff and get their agreement before restoring — timestamps alone don't tell anyone what a backup contains.

`--restore` with no target refuses to run and prints the list instead. That is deliberate; don't work around it.

## Why you must not guess

Every restore is itself an apply, so it takes its own backup. After one undo, the newest entry in the ring is the state you just undid. A silent "restore the newest" therefore toggles between two states while looking like it steps back through history — and the further back the user actually wanted to go, the more confidently it does the wrong thing.

The list makes the real shape visible, which is the whole point of showing it.

## The ring holds five

`ghostty-apply.sh` keeps the five most recent backups and deletes the rest (`GHOSTTY_BACKUP_KEEP` overrides the count; `0` means unlimited). Undos consume slots too, so a few rounds of undo and redo will push genuine history out.

If the user is hunting for a state that's several changes old, say early that the ring may not reach it, rather than restoring three times and discovering it's gone.

## After restoring

Tell them to reload Ghostty: `cmd+shift+,` on macOS, `ctrl+shift+,` on Linux.

The restore is validated and backed up like any other change, so it can itself be undone — the state you replaced is now number 1 in the list.

If there are no backups at all, say so plainly. This plugin knows only about changes it made itself; it will not try to reconstruct a config it never wrote.
