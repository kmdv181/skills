# Deliberately just a `cat`. The JSON is built ahead of time by scripts/build.sh
# and committed as hooks/session-start.json, so this cannot fail on a machine
# without jq, and there is no runtime string-escaping to get wrong. If the
# payload is missing, cat exits non-zero and the failure is visible rather than
# producing malformed JSON the CLI would silently drop.
